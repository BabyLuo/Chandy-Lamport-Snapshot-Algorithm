# Chandy-Lamport-Snapshot-Algorithm
Implemented Snapshot Algorithm (Chandy Lamport) widely used in Distributed Systems 

# Properties
This program computes a snapshot in financial transactions based on Chandy-Lamportâ€™s algorithm.  
Three processes (1, 2, and 3) all start with balance = $1,000. Every second, each process transfers some fund to another process. Also,
process 1 takes a snapshot every two seconds. 
The funds being transferred as well as the snapshots taken are displayed to the user.
